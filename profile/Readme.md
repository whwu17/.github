# Wenhan's Home

This personal website is originated from https://ivyee17.github.io. It is designed distributively from the original centralized personal website, as we give special acknowledgement to the origin.

## For users

Nothing more than visiting right now: https://whwu17.github.io/!

## For contributors

If you want to contribute to this personal page (e.g. more ideas, essays or even a repository), a merge request should be uploaded with the changes. 

A more simplified way is to issue in the discussion section, where we may give responses to the inspired thoughts.

## For developers

If you want to further develop any repository, fork and modify it. It's appreciated to be acknowledged if forking these repositories. Thanks~

The followings are the guidance for starting your own development. Jekyll and liquid knowledge are necessary to handle most of the problems. Good luck~

### Develop

This GitHub page was built with [Jekyll 3.9.2](http://jekyllrb.com/), and should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
